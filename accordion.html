                <button class="accordion fs-18 question"><span class="font-bold">SCIP:</span> Is it really that different for women in CI? </button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p class="fs-18 answer"><span class="font-bold">ZENA:</span> One of the limitations of digital communications is that we can lose 
                        tone and intent. In this question, my initial tongue and cheek response is “your bias is 
                        showing”. In other words, it’s that different for women in every and any profession. There
                        are biases everywhere, there is gender inequality and pay equity issues across the board 
                        and CI is not different or unique. That said, I do believe that statistically women are 
                        known to be more compassionate and collaborative, though less confident. When taken 
                        together these can be great skills when applied to CI, however from a management
                        opportunity and career path perspective, women still struggle more than men to 
                        get into the C-Suite.</p>

                <button class="accordion fs-18 question"><span class="font-bold">SCIP:</span> Relationship building is vital in CI. Can you speak to how you’ve seen women do this especially well?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p class="fs-18 answer"><span class="font-bold">ZENA:</span> Relationship building is pivotal in my opinion to gathering the best HUMINT (human intelligence related to any CI initiative).
                         Relationships like good intelligence take time, you need to develop trust. Again, this is something statistically women have been very strong in 
                         doing in the workplace. HUMINT is competitive differentiation and the ability to elicit the right information at the right time – that can then be
                          verified elsewhere – and can make all the difference to a company’s strategic priority.

                        Mentorship and sponsorship are critical to helping anyone succeed and both are needed throughout one’s career – not just at the beginning.
                        Mentorship is about helping individuals navigate through tricky or new situations, sponsorship is about recognizing someone’s potential 
                        and finding opportunities for people to stretch and then supporting them as they learn and grow. Professionals in the workplace and in life
                        need both sponsors and mentors to succeed in CI roles and elsewhere. Sharing your own experience, providing advice but also listening are
                        great ways to learn yourself. Recognizing potential in others and putting them up for bigger roles or adding them to project teams will
                        only strengthen their capabilities and the outcomes.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <button class="accordion fs-18 question"><span class="font-bold">SCIP:</span> Do you think that working remotely presents new challenges or opportunities for women to have more “voice at the table” in CI? </button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p class="fs-18 answer"> <span class="font-bold">ZENA:</span>  Being remote levels the playing field. We are all in the same size boxes on screens – there are no longer office divides and the hierarchy in the office has eroded,
                        we have a newfound intimacy as we are all invited into everyone’s houses each day. It’s a very unique experience, where we have met one another’s pets, children, partners or parents. 
                        We have seen unmade beds, fantastic art and other personal effects. Being remote I believe has changed perspectives for the better, there is more flexibility and more time to work in 
                        a way that makes sense for individual circumstances. A shift in perspective is always additive in my opinion to CI work, it makes analysis better when you can review data without rushing
                        and in a comfortable way. But being remote always blurs the lines between home and work in a way it never has before. Statistically women tend to take on more of the household and childcare 
                        responsibilities while still working and this can be challenging with the two so co-mingled right now. Burn out can happen faster and so we need to be take great care not to let that happen 
                        or work product of any kind and objectivity will suffer.

                <button class="accordion fs-18 question"><span class="font-bold">SCIP:</span> In what ways may women in CI roles communicate the value their different perspectives bring to the process? </button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p class="fs-18 answer"> <span class="font-bold">ZENA:</span>  This area is a challenge for women. As noted, confidence is often something we lack in CI or otherwise. To communicate value, you first need to demonstrate value. That’s critical, making certain you are providing value to initiatives is key. Getting a few wins under your belt , even small ones will give you the confidence to push harder to demonstrate that the different perspectives you can bring to an individual analysis or initiative can reveal blind spots, reveal or help eliminate bias and over all contribute to a better, more well-rounded outcome. Communicating value is hard but it starts with demonstrating value beyond group thinking and then taking the time to share and celebrate well crafted examples of how the difference in perspective made the difference in the outcome or object.

                        This is a huge topic, and we barely scratched the surface but these are great conversations to be having for any amount of time. Gender diversity and equity in the work place is a big issue that will evolve and change over time, the work will never done. Thank you again to SCIP for giving me an opportunity to share my experience at this precarious moment in time. I hope I can come back and talk with your members again to keep the conversation going.
